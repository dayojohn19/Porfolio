// Christmas Eve is almost upon us, so naturally we need to prepare some milk and cookies for Santa! Create a function that accepts a Date object and returns true if it'`s Christmas Eve (December 24th) and false otherwise. Keep in mind JavaScript's Date month is 0 based, meaning December is the 11th month while January is 0.`


function triangle(n) {
	x = 0
    for (i=0; i<=n; i++){
        x+=i;
    }
    return x
}

console.log(triangle(215))
